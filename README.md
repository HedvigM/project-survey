# Survey form with React

This project was about creating a form using components, props, and states.

## The problem

First, I created the form elements in one file, and later divided them into individual components. Then I made the process work and then I themed the form. I had some problems with the radio buttons, but solved it using props. If I had more time, I would make animated transitions between form questions and perhaps spice up the design.
